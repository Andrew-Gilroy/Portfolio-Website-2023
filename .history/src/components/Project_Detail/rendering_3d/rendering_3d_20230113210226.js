            As 3D modelling enthusiast I often look for ways to bring my designs to the next level. To achieve this I use the incredible (and free!) 3d editing software Blender or software from the adobe creative cloud such as Aftereffects or Photoshop.

            Blender has a raft of great new features such as the ability to edit live rendered objects via the new eevee renderer. I hope to grow my skills with the software in time so that I harness its full potential.

            I have been using 3d editing software in various capacities from a very early age. As an avid gamer I would often use inbuilt level editors to design, texture and build my own multiplayer levels or single player scenarios. Halflife and Quake 2 we both very popular games in the late 90's which both came with their own 3d editors which I used extensively at the time.

The finished models were then placed in more appealing and atmospheric home settings.
