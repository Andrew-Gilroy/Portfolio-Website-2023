# My Portfolio Website
Updated in 2023 after many breaking bugs due to outdated Gatsby and other dependencies!

Notes: use "Gatsby develop" then "Gatsby serve" (to check the site on a server). Finally use "Gatsby build". Upload the contents of the public folder to the hosting service, in this case my Google Cloud bucket.
